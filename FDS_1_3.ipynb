Another thing is that many famous mathematicians or physicists were born intelligent and gifted or else they became obsessed with matter from childhood and they investigated on their own and saw that they have talent, I have none of that, I chose study the degree as an epiphany and because if I was interested in those subjects, but I can   t find a solid relationship with mathematics or physics, I can   t and my worst fear is not knowing my talent or what I am suitable for, I perceive myself as someone insignificant who sometimes I think about death or the past, and as having been born in a country like Bolivia and being a student in a Catholic school in which I am an average student, even though I was recognized as the 3rd best, I am not able to assess This honor because it is from a school that I do not consider intellectually demanding or stimulating, I tried to join Cheenta   s group   Indian youtube song about mathematics   but they rejected me or rather they eliminated me because at that moment I had given up being a mathematician, Now I   m looking for a mentor or tutor to help me strengthen my math skills.

In my view, the best approach to uncover meaningful patterns from feeding complex inputs into the zeta function may be to use a split screen  the left side could show the complex plane with dots of particular colors denoting complex inputs, while the right side maps those inputs through the zeta function, using the same colors to connect inputs to outputs. This visualization may reveal salient correspondences and patterns. The name    1blueComplexInput1blueComplexOutput    reflects this color-coded mapping of complex numbers. I believe this technique will yield valuable insights, patterns, and formulas relating complex inputs to outputs of this profound mathematical function.

Instead this illustrates that the driving forces in the universe when it comes to galaxies, star formation etc are electromagnetic in nature as gravitation can not cause such effects. Instead of introducing these known well known forces into astrophysical models, we have a science mafia that insists that unknown particles and hidden forces   called dark matter and dark energy   lead to such phenomena allowing them to build more useless even larger accelerators after LHC failed to produce any piece of such particles, nor is there any other experiment.

When I first learned about prime numbers and the feeling stands true still today I feel they are a mystery.   While I did not understand the video and its meaning,  I do understand plotting points on an axis and how these points when connected can create pictures.  However, the author says that they only use prime numbers which makes the math more complex and interesting.  How can prime numbers which seem random create such a beautiful spiral design and when zoomed out how the spirals suddenly change to rays.  It leaves one to think could this be done on any type of plane or only on one that is polar? However, the whole video reminded me of a clock and I am glad he explained it in such a way but there again how did it create a spiral.  From my understanding the numbers must be factored within 2 pie.  Also, it is interesting with in the Dirichlet theory is that all the primes are residue of equal amounts and has infinitely many primes.  So what I learned in the end is that all math is important and it leads to more mathematical thought\\u201athen you must dig deeper and learn how it is connected to a basic concept.

To first approximation, the distribution is the same in all classes. However, in a strong sense, there are more primes in non-residue classes than in residue classes.

Therefore your life is cruisy because you   re not facing terminal illness    like obviously that point of view is wrong because the ill life is not cruisy, it can only be described as that by someone with something worse. That   s why I can   t understand where you   re coming from when you say    My working conditions are pretty good    if your working conditions are pretty good and you   re calling 9-5 cruisy then you could only really be saying stuff like    dude the 9-5 is cruisy. Try doing nights six days a week    for two reasons. You   re working a harder, more demanding job than a 9-5, or you know and sympathize with someone specific working a harder, more demanding job than a 9-5.

They get through school by memorizing so they don   t have to understand, and then they spend their entire lives just doing the same stuff over and over by rote.  Idealistic young math teachers fresh out of college often don   t know this, but by the time they   ve been teaching for 30 years, they   re usually a bit more jaded.\\n\\n\\nYou can tell which kind of student is which in geometry class, when you assign proofs.  Most of the students will   at best   come up with the official stock proofs, which are usually 3-5 steps long, either because they copy off someone else, or because they dutifully memorize every single theorem, including all the ones with 3 step proofs.  High school geometry texts are designed so that if you do this, you never need to put together a proof more than about 5 steps long, and also so that all the theorems you need for each of your proofs are within the last chapter or two.  \\n\\n\\nWhen you see a student who doesn   t bother to memorize all the trivial and obvious theorems, so then his proofs are 30+ steps long but entirely valid, you know you   re dealing with someone who actually understands what   s going on.

Since you mentioned that is a good idea to think of vectors as dots, and since we have three linearly independent vectors, it would make sense that we can get all possible points within the 3D vector space since one of the requirements of a vector space is for it   the linear combination of the vectors   to have the properties of scalar addition and closed under multiplication which opens the door for an infinite way of expressing this linear combination since, in theory, we are open to all real numbers within the vector space. so we can get a sphere if we expand the numbers out from their respected origins.\\nI am trying to understand.\"],[\"Gotta confess this is the 3rd or 4th time I watch thiw video and I am finally getting it.

But I have got one doubt regarding span of two 3d vectors, explained at 6.50. since there are two 3d vectors and each 3d vector has x, y and z components, shouldn   t the tip of their combination  be in any 3d space? But it   s saying, it   s going to be in a flat sheet passing through origin. How come it   s confining in a flat sheet? In 2 d space, two vectors not in same line can combine and scale to become any point in 2d flat sheet. So, applying the same logic here, two 3d vectors combine to be any point in 3d space right? Why should there be another vector to form combination that can be in any point in space? Could you please help me here?\"],[\"For somebody somehow getting this confusion, I had this doubt because, I was not understanding the concept for scaling and span. Scaling basically doesn   t change the direction of the vector, it just change the magnitude in the same line.

Otherwise, something like    linear independence    meant nothing more than some more math. Thanks a lot  \"],[\"A basis of a vector space is a set of vectors that create the space and are linearly independent. This definition makes sense because every vector in space can be created by a linear combination of basis vectors, and every basis vector is important because of linear independence. So you couldn   t take a vector away from the base. And if you add another vector to the basis, it is no longer a basis because the vectors become linearly dependent.\\nWith the basis vectors you can represent any vector in vector space through linear combination. The scalars are clearly determined.   consequence of linear independence  \\nA vector space can have many different possible bases.

However, by changing the frequency or firing rate of emitting these action potentials   basically the rate of emitting 1   s and 0   s  , different stimulus intensities can be encoded   more frequent APs correspond to a higher intensity stimulus, less frequent APs correspond to a lower intensity stimulus  . I would therefore argue that the    activation    of a biological neuron is also continuous and not necessarily binary.\\nOf course this has nothing to do with the content of the actual video, which is a really good   and intuitive   explanation on Gradient Descent   way more intuitive than when I learned that in university  D  .\"],[\"Well, I   m certainly no expert in this matter, so I   ll defer to your judgement.\\u00a0\\u00a0But I always viewed the stimulus as analogous to the weighted sum for ANNs, not the activation.\\u00a0\\u00a0That the stimulation might vary continuously in biological networks, but the actual activation of the relevant neuron has basically two states.\\u00a0\\u00a0I suppose if you consider a high frequency firing to be similar to a higher intensity firing, in that sense it could have a more continuous activation, but that does feel a bit different in character.\\u00a0\\u00a0Either way, thanks for the input  \"],[\"I wonder if that strobey kinda firing is useful in networks that loop upon themselves, perhaps to help regulate path traversal rate since I understand that biological neurons learn every firing.\"],[\"3Blue1Brown it   s kind of like with an Arduino, where you can emulate an analog signal by switching a digital signal at high frequencies.\\u00a0Conversely, biological neurons also fire in an additional dimension - time - which has a non-trivial impact on the function of the network... Which after trying to compress into a YouTube comment, I realize is beyond the scope of the medium. But yeah, extended firing can even bring other neurons over their activation threshold even if a shorter pulse wouldn   t, which means it has a direct effect on the function of the network.\"],[\"Math courses in my college are basically trash compared to your videos , finally now I understand how math is being applied in computer science .

Aren   t labels are just labels   names  ? It doesn   t matter how you call them in which language.\"],[\"1 year late but if your labels of data are random, then when you try to do gradient descent to minimise the cost then there   s not any defined relationships between the input and the random label. Like if you had an image of a dog being paired with money, and cat being paired with earlobe, for the network to find the right parameters to get dog to match with money and cat to match with earlobe is more difficult a task than getting an image of a dog to match with an actual dog. When you have the right labels, it means that there are features that the network is looking for in an input to get the desired output label. When you have random labels there will be no concept of finding features. This means that with properly labelled data different costs of different inputs for different parameters are all trying to identify features in a similar way from data. So finding where to change the weights and biases to make the output closer to the label can be done methodically rather than finding the combination of parameters that    sticks    and gives you accurate outputs.

Eventually, once you get off the wall then the next immediate maximum decrease in the value of the function will be to the right, descending down into the hole. This process continues on an infinitesimal scale until you reach a pit where the decrease in the value of a function is zero in all directions - which is a local minimum. Remember that the maximum increase in the gradient vector is in the direction of the gradient vector - so the maximum decrease will be in the opposite direction and because this process is infinitesimal you will follow a path that will take you to a local minimum.
