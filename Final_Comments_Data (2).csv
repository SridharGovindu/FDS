"I did a trip across a few states recently. I enjoyed 5G on Jio wherever it was available. The issue is still that of coverage. While on the train, the signal was okay for voice, but data speeds and stability were poor. The operators need to work on this. Also, for me, the slightly frustrating part is that the towers near my house haven't been upgraded yet, so I need to travel about half a kilometer to get 5G. Anyway, the WiFi at home is solid.",youtube,1,Airtel
Youtubers living in Tier 1 cities take WiFi for granted. Most people living in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities still rely on mobile data and mobile hotspots to fulfill their internet needs. 5G is like a boon for these people. They can work from home using their 5G mobile data instead of waiting for Jio and Airtel to install fiber cables in the city.,youtube,1,Airtel

"Chirag and the Chinese are right. Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities have fiber available. But, but... what do they know about where fiber is available in villages...

"I am a VI user, enjoying 4G unlimited data from 12 AM to 6 AM.""",youtube,1,Vodafone
I have both Vi and Jio.,youtube,1,Vodafone

How does Airtel unlimited work? My 1.5 GB data ends and the internet stops.,youtube,1,Vodafone
"t works in airplane mode or you can change the APN; there won't be any problems, but it will be off from 2 AM to 6 AM.",youtube,1,Vodafone
Vi is the worst SIM in the world.,youtube,-1,Vodafone
"350 Mbps speed and 4GB pack. Brother, if you do a speed test 4-5 times, the data will be over. How can you use it? Max to max, watch 2 videos and the pack is over.",youtube,-1,Vodafone
"Is Jio 5G unlimited like Airtel, or does the data get used up? And where are you from, Pune or Delhi? Currently, 5G is only in these two places for Vi.",youtube,1,Vodafone

"But in Vi's unlimited plan, there’s unlimited data from midnight to morning, so I use it at night and Airtel during the day.",youtube,1,Vodafone
Vi will surely sink.,youtube,-1,Vodafone
"As per my opinion, Vi SIM needs to give unlimited data for 4G.",youtube,1,Vodafone
Vi 4G is better than Airtel and Jio 5G.,youtube,1,Vodafone
"Yes, it's true. The downloading and uploading speed of Vi 4G is the same as others' 5G",youtube,1,Vodafone
"Vi goes up to 60 Mbps, so always like it.",youtube,1,Vodafone
"True, Vi 4G is very fast.",youtube,1,Vodafone
My Jio 5G speed is 800 Mbps on average.,youtube,1,Vodafone
"It would be a big deal if I could even make a call with my Vi, and I don't expect much from the internet. But here, Airtel and Jio 5G give around 250 Mbps speed.",youtube,-1,Vodafone
"At my location, I get up to 150 Mbps speed on the Jio 5G SIM.",youtube,1,Vodafone
"Not true, my Airtel 4G gives 50-60 Mbps download speeds.",youtube,-1,Vodafone
"I know, use Jio 5G also, but I am talking about 4G. If you compare it with Jio 4G, then Vi will win.",youtube,1,Vodafone
"I have both; Vi speed is 4 Mbps, and Jio 5G speed is 30 Mbps.",youtube,-1,Vodafone
"I know Vi 4G is faster, but Jio 4G has more traffic than Vi, so of course, it will be slower. But they are saying that 4G is faster than 5G.",youtube,1,Vodafone
"I used Vodafone SIM and threw it away, now I'm using Airtel.",youtube,-1,Vodafone
"It just depends on area coverage and network strength; some SIM cards work best in some areas, and some don't.",youtube,1,Vodafone
Vi’s real download speed is 9 Mbps.,youtube,-1,Vodafone
"Bruh, I use Jio 4G on a 2020 4G device (using it for 4 years), and I usually get 7 MBps, sometimes 11 MBps if the servers are good.",youtube,1,Vodafone
My download speed is 300 Mbps to 1 Gbps. Does your 4G give this much speed?,youtube,1,Vodafone
"Yeah, bro, I received up to 70 Mbps connection speed in Vi 4G.",youtube,1,Vodafone
"My Vi also drops calls, but the internet works fine.",youtube,-1,Vodafone
I normally get 7-8 MBps (or 56-64 Mbps) downloading speed from Vi.,youtube,1,Vodafone
"If there are fewer users, the speed will be good, right?",youtube,1,Vodafone
And Jio 4G speed is 800 kbps to 1.5 or 2 Mbps.,youtube,1,Vodafone
" bro, I got approximately 30 Mbps in Airtel 5G Plus, but in Vi 4G, I only get a maximum of 10-12 Mbps.",youtube,1,Vodafone
Jio's 4G + goes up to 90 Mbps at night and stays at 30 Mbps during the day. And Vodafone doesn't even support 4G+.,youtube,-1,Vodafone

"I am a Vi user and a happy Vi user, but comparing 4G to 5G is something else.",youtube,1,Vodafone
"I am on Jio 5G, getting 700 Mbps to 1 Gbps speed after 12 AM.",youtube,1,Vodafone
"So true, man. I get 10-11 Mbps on Vi 4G, while 19-25 Mbps on Airtel 5G. By the way, I am talking about Mbps, not MBps.",youtube,-1,Vodafone
I get 280+ Mbps speeds from Jio 5G,youtube,1,Vodafone
"Yes, I have Vi, and my roommate has Jio 5G, and his internet speed is far slower than my 4G. Also, a friend who lives in the same building has Jio and always complains about it. I have a dual SIM, one Vi, one Jio. Vi internet works great, but Jio sucks. I only recharge Jio because when I travel, it helps me due to its wide network availability.",youtube,1,Vodafone
 I work from home using Vi internet very comfortably.,youtube,1,Vodafone
"Not true, in Pune, I get crap speed even with full range.",youtube,-1,Vodafone
 I have Airtel 5G; I get 50/70 Mbps download speed.,youtube,1,Vodafone
"Vi speed goes up to 8 MBps, and my Jio 5G goes up to 80 MBps.",youtube,-1,Vodafone
"Even I do get a good 50-60 Mbps speed of Vi in Mumbai and a good stable network with better call quality, at least better than Airtel",youtube,1,Vodafone
"Yes, brother, Vi is the best. I also use a Vi 4G SIM, still better than Airtel and Jio.",youtube,1,Vodafone
You can check on YouTube about the speed of 4G+ in Vi.,youtube,1,Vodafone
